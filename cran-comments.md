    - NOTE 1 - The Bernadette package uses the rstan and Rcpp packages to compile models.
    The libs/ directory is where the compiled model object is stored. See [this](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/using-rstan-in-an-r-package-generates-r-cmd-check-notes/26628) Stan Forums thread.

    - NOTE 2 - GNU make is needed for handling the Makevars files that rstantools uses to compile  the packages Stan models. Itâ€™s fairly commonly used for R packages with more complex Makefile needs.
