## Test environments

* Local:
  - Windows 10, R 4.2.2 (x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit))
* R-hub builder (https://builder.r-hub.io)
  - Windows Server 2022 R-devel, 64 bit
    - NOTE 1 - The Bernadette package uses the rstan and Rcpp packages to compile models.
    The libs/ directory is where the compiled model object is stored. See [this](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/using-rstan-in-an-r-package-generates-r-cmd-check-notes/26628) Stan Forums thread.

    - NOTE 2 - GNU make is needed for handling the Makevars files that rstantools uses to compile the packages Stan models. Itâ€™s fairly commonly used for R packages with more complex Makefile needs.
