**Bernadette** provides a framework for Bayesian analysis of infectious disease transmission dynamics via diffusion driven multi-type epidemic models with time-varying coefficients, with a particular focus on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It allows for evaluation of probabilistic forecasts with proper scoring rules, for the purpose of model comparison.
