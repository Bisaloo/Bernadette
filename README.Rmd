## Overview

The **Bernadette** ("Bayesian inference and model selection for stochastic epidemics") R package provides a framework for Bayesian analysis of infectious disease transmission dynamics via diffusion driven multi-type epidemic models with time-varying coefficients, with a particular focus on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For models fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo, it allows for computation of approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO, LOOIC) or the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) using the **loo** package for the purpose of model comparison.

## Website

The website for the BERNADETTE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) is available at: https://bernadette-eu.github.io/

## Installation

Installation of the package requires you to have a working C++ toolchain. 
To ensure that this is working, please first install **rstan** by following these [installation instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) from the Rstan wiki.

The following must return ```TRUE``` before continuing:

```
if (!require("pkgbuild")) {
  install.packages("pkgbuild")
}
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

Having installed **rstan**, you can then install the latest development version of **Bernadette** (requires the [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package) from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("bernadette-eu/Bernadette", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE)
library("Bernadette")
``` 

## Example - COVID-19 in Greece

## Plotting the posterior estimates of epidemiological quantities

## Contributing

File an issue [here](https://github.com/bernadette-eu/Bernadette/issues) if you have identified an issue with the package. 
We welcome all contributions, in particular those that improve the approach or the robustness of the code base. We also welcome 
additions and extensions to the underlying model either in the form of options or improvements.
