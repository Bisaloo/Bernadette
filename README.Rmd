## Overview

The **Bernadette** ("Bayesian inference and model selection for stochastic epidemics") R package provides a framework for Bayesian analysis of infectious disease transmission dynamics via diffusion driven multi-type epidemic models with time-varying coefficients, with a particular focus on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It allows for evaluation of probabilistic forecasts with proper scoring rules, for the purpose of model comparison.

The website for the BERNADETTE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) is available at: https://bernadette-eu.github.io/

## Installation

Installation of the package requires you to have a working C++ toolchain. 
To ensure that this is working, please first install **rstan** by following these [installation instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) from the Rstan wiki.

The following must return ```TRUE``` before continuing:

```
if (!require("pkgbuild")) {
  install.packages("pkgbuild")
}
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

Having installed **rstan**, you can then install the latest development version of **Bernadette** (requires the [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package) from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("bernadette-eu/Bernadette", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE)
library("Bernadette")
```
