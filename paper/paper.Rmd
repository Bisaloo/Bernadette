# Summary

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to developments in Bayesian infectious disease modeling, allowing modelers to assess the impact of mitigation strategies on transmission and quantify the burden of the pandemic. 
The package `Bernadette` implements a Bayesian evidence synthesis approach to modeling the age-specific transmission dynamics of a disease based on daily mortality counts. 
The functionality of `Bernadette` can be used to reconstruct the epidemic drivers from publicly available data, to estimate key epidemiological quantities like the rate of disease transmission, the latent counts of infections and the reproduction number for a given population, and to perform model checking and model comparison using information criteria.
